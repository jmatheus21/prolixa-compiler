This is program Teste.

It presents:
alterable number Num;
alterable symbol Tempo;
unalterable symbol Symb;
vector of number (2) Vetor;
alterable number Numero;

Let us begin:
Num := 10 + 3;
Tempo = 'i' + 'j';
Symb = 'c';

just in case that (Num == 10) do show(Symb);

considering Numero from 0 to 3 by 1 do [
    show(Numero);
	just in case that (Numero == 1) do abandon;
]

That would be all.
